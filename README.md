## Task: 
Peter Pandey, acting as a data analyst, took advantage of the transparent data policy of Telangana, a progressive Indian state, to delve into their tourism figures. Pandey's goal was to identify trends in the data, conduct further research, and provide evidence-based suggestions to the Telangana government for revenue enhancement and administrative improvement. The challenge was to step into Pandey's shoes and perform a similar analysis.

## Methodology: 
Employed tools such as MySQL, Microsoft PowerBI, and MS Excel.

## Findings: 
Domestic tourists contribute more to revenue than foreign tourists. There's been an upward trajectory in the number of foreign visitors over time, but domestic visitors showed a downturn, except for a 8.93% uptick in 2018. Revenue bifurcation for weekdays and weekends stood at 329 bn and 104 bn respectively, implying a preference for weekend travel. Hyderabad attracts the most tourists, while Kamareddy has the least footfall. Visitor numbers surge between January-March and June-July, with a similar trend seen among domestic travelers; however, foreign visitors prefer the October-January period.

## Recommendations:
To boost revenue, it may be beneficial to organize crowd-puller events like celebrity performances, musical nights, and beach festivals during off-peak seasons. For high-demand periods, offering stay packages, discount coupons, vouchers, and camping options could be a lucrative strategy.


I am grateful for the opportunity provided by Hemanand Vadivel, Dhaval Patel, and Bhavin Patel to learn and demonstrate my skills through such projects. I appreciate the vision of Mr. Kalvakuntla Taraka Rama Rao, the esteemed IT Minister of Telangana, for making real data accessible to the public.
